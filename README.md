# CompassNoNewTabs Firefox Extension
Do you get fed up using Compass for more than 5 minutes and ending up with a million tabs open?</br></br>
So do I!</br></br>
But that no longer has to be the case. ðŸ˜Š</br>

## Functionality:
The extension is set to only remove the 'open in new tab' functionality from Compass portals.<br>It will only apply to websites with the address "https://myschoolhere.compass.education".

**Removes** all "_blank" from links except for the following:

a. Email tab (only applies to DOE WA portals)</br>
b. School Favourites</br>
c. Quick Actions</br>

Now **adds** "_blank" to any links present in the body of News Feed items. To ensure they always open in a new tab.

You can enable/disable the extension in a flash, clicking on the extension icon in the menubar gives you the option to enable or disable on the fly.

## Support:
This version of the extenion supports **Firefox**!

[**Chrome** & **Edge** are supported.](https://github.com/TheFauxDreamer/CompassNoNewTabs/tree/main)</br>
